# Tasky
This is the main root for tasky, it contains some useful stuff to get Tasky going.

Of course, you can make your own scripts to run Tasky independently or however you like, but in this case this will help you get an out of the box solution.

For Linux:
There are some scripts available so that you can use systemd. See the linux folder


For Mac:
Unfortunately systemd isnt the same for Mac, which is slightly infuriating. If you have any ideas how you'd like this to be automated for Mac, let me know.
